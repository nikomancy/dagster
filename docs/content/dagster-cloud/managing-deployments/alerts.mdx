# Dagster Cloud alerts

<ApplicableDagsterProduct />

Using Dagster Cloud's built-in alerting system, you can stay in the loop on the events occurring in your deployment. Dagster Cloud alerts integrate with several popular services, allowing you to deliver notifications when and where they're most needed.

---

## How it works

Alerts are created using **alert policies**. An alert policy defines [the conditions that will trigger an alert](#alert-policy-types) and [how the alert will be sent](#supported-notification-services). For example, you can create a policy that sends an alert to a Slack channel when any asset in a specific asset group fails to materialize.

Alert policies are configured on a **per-deployment basis**. This means, for example, that asset alerts configured in a `prod` deployment are only applicable to assets in that deployment.

### Alert policy types

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "25%",
        }}
      >
        Policy type
      </th>
      <th>How it works</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Asset alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers on:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Asset materializations</strong> - Failure or success
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asset checks</strong> - Error, warn, passed, or failure to
            execute
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asset freshness</strong> - Overdue
          </li>
        </ul>
        Alerts can be scoped to asset groups or specific asset keys. Asset check
        alerts are sent for any checks on those assets.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Run alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers on job run success or failure; may optionally include a set of
        configured tags. If an alert policy has no configured tags, all jobs
        will be eligible for that alert. Otherwise, only jobs that contain all
        the tags for a given alert policy are eligible for that alert.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Schedule/Sensor alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers when a schedule or sensor tick failure occurs for any schedule
        or sensor in the deployment. <strong>Note</strong>: Alerts are sent only
        when the schedule/sensor changes from <strong>success</strong> to{" "}
        <strong>failure</strong>, so subsequent failures won't trigger new
        alerts.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Code location error alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>Triggers when a code location fails to load due to an error.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Agent downtime alert</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers when a Hybrid agent hasn't heartbeated within the last five
        minutes. Available for{" "}
        <a href="/dagster-cloud/deployment/hybrid">Hybrid deployments</a> only.

    </tr>

        <strong>Insights metric alert</strong> <Experimental />
      </td>

        <strong>
          A Dagster Cloud Pro plan is required to use this feature.
        </strong>
        <br />
        Sends a notification when a{" "}
        <a href="/dagster-cloud/insights">Dagster Cloud Insights</a> metric
        exceeds or falls below a specified threshold over a specified time
        window. This can be used to alert on:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dagster credit usage across a deployment or for a specific job
          </li>
          <li>Performance regressions on asset or job runtime</li>
          <li>Spend on external tools such as Snowflake or BigQuery credits</li>
        </ul>
        Alerts can be scoped to the sum of any metric across an entire
        deployment, or for a specific job, asset group, or asset key.
        <br />
        <strong>Note</strong>: Alerts are sent only when the threshold is first
        crossed, and will not be sent again until the value returns to expected
        levels. Insights data may become available up to 24 hours after run
        completion.
